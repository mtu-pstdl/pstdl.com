## Project Overview
Molten Regolith Electrolysis, or MRE, uses an electric current in a reactor to separate oxygen from lunar dust, also known as regolith. The scope of the project is to provide a regolith feeder and transportation system for the MRE reactor. Large amounts of regolith will be required to operate the MRE reactor. Lunar regolith is a difficult granular material to handle. It is very abrasive, like powdered glass, and intensely sticks to surfaces because of the hooks in the structure of the granular material but also the static charge the grains have from being exposed to the sun in a vacuum. Research into regolith properties, here on Earth, and in extreme environments like lunar gravity and vacuum are being conducted. Results from these experiments will be vital in choosing and developing these feeder and transportation technologies.
