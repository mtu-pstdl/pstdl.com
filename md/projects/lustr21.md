## Project Overview
The novel compaction system uses long pins which are inserted while vibrating, reducing resistance in entering the regolith and providing the necessary energy to reorganize particles to a more compact state. A surface plate applies the vehicle's mass to prevent free movement of particles at the surface. In a lunar environment we cannot assume uniformity in the pre-compacted bed and buried obstacles would hinder full compaction of a site. To address this the compactorâ€™s needles will each be independent, attached via a spring to the main motion stage allowing the pins to deflect when the preload is met.
