## Project Overview
A table top Acrylic Vacuum chamber rated for 10-3 Torr. The MTVAC is used to simulate the atmospheric pressure and temperatures on the surface of Mars for the RedWater project. This vacuum chamber features a total of 10 feedthrough ports. Current feedthroughs being used include K-type thermocouples, liquid nitrogen supply and exhaust tubes, electrical wiring, and a digital pressure sensor.
