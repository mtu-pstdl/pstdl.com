## Project Overview
The regolith freezing and heating containers are utilized for the preparation, testing, and desiccation of large mixed icy regolith simulant samples. Capable of mixing and desiccating regolith simulant in the order of tens of thousands of kilograms for larger test beds.

## Technical Details
- The freezer container is capable of maintaining `-4.4 oC (24 oF)` allowing water to be frozen and mixed with our MTU-LHT-1A simulant as either discrete ice shavings or as cemented “mud pie” samples.
- The heating container is capable of maintaining `62.7 oC (145 oF)` allowing the complete desiccation of 100s of kilograms of our MTU-LHT-1A simulant.
