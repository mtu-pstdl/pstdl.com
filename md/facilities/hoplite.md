## Project Overview
The Heavy Onboard Platform for Lunar ISRU and Terrain Excavation (HOPLITE) is a modular robotic system built at
Michigan Technological University (MTU) that enables the field testing of ISRU technologies. Many payloads are
currently being designed and implemented for lunar applications and there is a need for accurate, reliable, and safe
mobility of these payloads during field testing. Using a large sensor array, fine tuned control, and autonomy,
HOPLITE is designed to provide a solution to this need.
