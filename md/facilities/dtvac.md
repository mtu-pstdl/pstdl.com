## Project Overview
The Dusty Thermal Vacuum Chamber (DTVAC) is a facility used to simulate extreme extraplanetary environments such as Lunar PSRs and the Martian surface. The DTVAC is customized for rapid servicing of meter-class payloads via removable sandbox carts capable of holding icy regolith.
