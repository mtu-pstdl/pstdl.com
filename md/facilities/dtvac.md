## Overview

The Dusty Thermal Vacuum Chamber (DTVAC) is a facility used to simulate extreme extraplanetary environments such as Lunar PSRs and the Martian surface. The DTVAC is customized for rapid servicing of meter-class payloads via removable sandbox carts capable of holding icy regolith.

## Technical Details

- The chamber has an internal volume of `127x127x178 cm` and is loaded from the side for ease of access. A `22in` flange on top of the chamber enables future expansions to support large-scale drilling tests.
- This facility is cooled by a `3125 gallon LN2` tank and warmed by internal heaters to produce operating temperatures between `-196°C` and `150°C`. This range is able to simulate temperatures found in most illuminated and shaded areas of the Moon.
- Rough vacuum is reached with a roughing pump and is then taken to `5x10^-6` Torr using a turbopump with no simulant present and `5x10^-4` with simulant.
- The DTVAC has 2 light sources and 6 mounting points internally placed on the chamber ceiling.
- The facility is currently configured to support power lines rated for `700 volts / 28 A`, a 25pin data connection, and 2X 5-pair thermocouple feedthroughs

### Regolith Cart

- 2X rectangular metal carts that roll into the vacuum facility from an enclosed loading area.
- Each cart has an Internal volume of `60x116x167` cm.
- Carts are capable of holding up to `60` cm of dry and or icy regolith mixtures.
- MTU-LHT-1A simulant for the regolith carts is produced in house.
- 80/20 rails line all sides of the cart lip for equipment mounting.
