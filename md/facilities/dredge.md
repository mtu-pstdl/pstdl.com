## Facility Overview
The DREDGE, a force test stand, is able to collect force data from material handling systems in temperatures of -40 to 20C. eight s-type load cells located with the frame measure the compressive and tensile forces acting on the mounted system. In this temperature range, the lunar simulant properties are more accurate to permanently shadowed regions of the moon.

## Technical Details
* The DREDGE uses a modular E-Box and DAQ system that controls and collects data through different circuits within the Freezer Container
* 8 S-Type load cells allow 3-axis force measurements
* The DREDGE operates in temperatures within -40 to 20C 
* A fixture plate is mounted to the X-axis for easy attachment of a material bed
* The gantry system has a similar fixture plate for the interface of excavators, core drills, and more
